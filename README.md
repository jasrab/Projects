# Finished Projects
Below is a chronoligical list of repository content outlining project details.

### Engine Cooling System

Project Description: Model electric radiator fan using Arduino. Its objective is to cool the main engine of a system, preventing it from overheating during operation. The Arduino sketch consists of two main sections: an Automated Cooling System loop and a Manual Overide Cooling System loop. The Automated loop uses input from the temperature sensor to determine fan on/off state and speed, resulting in a self regulating process. The Manual Override loop is activated by a switch button and uses user input from the potentiometer to determine fan speed. The operation LED lights and warning alarm are regulated by the temperature sensor. A circuit schematic is also included to accompany the Arduino sketch.

### Steam Table Project

Project Description: Superheated vapor property calculator. Its objective is to determine the thermodynamic state properties for a superheated vapor between 0.01MPa and 1.0MPa. Given user input of pressure OR temperature + one other property, the code uses functions findT, findP, and findVal to search an Excel database to determine corresponding temperature/pressure, specific volume, specific enthalpy, specific entropy, and specific internal energy. If the user input is not part of the database, linear interpolation is used to calculate approximate property values.

### Numerical Analysis Algorithms

Project Description: A collection of useful numerical analysis scripts. Its objective is to exercise the application of numerical methods by remaking several MatLab functions such as roots, eig, lu & chol factorization, and integral. Each re-written MatLab function consists of two scripts: one for user input and the second containing the numerical algorithm.
